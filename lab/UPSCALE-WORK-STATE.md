Updated: 2026-10-14 (Berlin).
Scope: curated SeedVR2 default replacing the public economical method.
Branch: feat/pv-lab-premium-seedvr2-20261014
Base main commit: 4f41522ee91c2861ae3b6d8f18957b5575f5313e

## Approved choices
- Sole public Upscaler method: Premium Upscale, ByteDance SeedVR2 on fal.ai.
- 2× Premium: 10 credits; 4× Ultra: 18 credits.
- Preserve source ratio, original media and history; PNG/JPEG.
- Noise scale 0.1 and 32 MP output cap.
- Historical SpicyAPI/Topaz records remain accessible; Reuse upgrades to Premium Upscale.
- Do not claim identity with Higgsfield's ByteDance image enhancer, which is unverified.

## Implementation
- lab-worker/fal-upscale.mjs: model parameters, pricing estimate, input and dimensions.
- lab-worker/worker.mjs: bound quote, private uploads, task confirmation, recovery.
- lab-worker/job-pricing.mjs: exact, server-validated 10/18 credit prices.
- lab-worker/migrations/0014-premium-upscale-credits.sql: SQL billing trigger with old prices preserved.
- .github/workflows/deploy-lab-worker.yml: remote migration before Worker deployment.
- lab/lab.js, lab/studio.html, lab/assets.css: compact premium deck and mobile layout.
- Tests: lab-worker, Upscale UI and Upscale Assets visibility.

## Deployment
- Reuses FAL_KEY; never expose to the browser. No new provider keys.
- Retains owner isolation, quote expiry, single submission, image capacity, recovery and refunds.
- No paid image job submitted during development.
- CI and production deploy still need verification.
- After merge, verify migration, health, front-end and one authorized paid image smoke test.
